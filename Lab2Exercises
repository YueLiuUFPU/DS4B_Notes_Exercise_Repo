DSB Lab2 Homework

Exercise 1

Assume you are collecting insects at three different locations, three times a year, over the span of three years. For each day/location of sampling, you record:

§Site data: site of the sampling, its geographic coordinates, description of the site
§Sampling data: day, month, and year, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, etc.;
§Species data: classification according to species and stage of development of all the insects collected, their total, and their measurements
Write out the plan of your design of all the tables you are making, and how you are going to relate them together.

Fist, I will make a table (table 1) for site information including variables as site id, site of the sampling, geographic coordinates, and description of the site. Each variable occupies a column in the table.

Then, I plan to make a table (table 2) for sampling information including variables as sampling id, day, month, and year, weather conditions, temperature, and humidity. Each variable occupies a column in the table.

Third, I plan to make a table (table 3) for species data including site id, sampling id, species name, stage of development the collected insect, total number of collected insects for this species, and their measurements. Each variable occupies a column in the table.

The first two columns in table 3 (the "site id" and "sampling id") are used to relate site information and sampling information to species data.



Exercise 2 code
get the first two lines of all the files ending with .csv within data/ directory, and save them to a single file called “headers.csv” under sandbox/
